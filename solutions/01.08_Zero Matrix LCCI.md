## 01.08. Zero Matrix LCCI
[Zero Matrix LCCI](https://leetcode.cn/problems/zero-matrix-lcci/)  

Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0.


Example 1:

Input:   
[  
  [1,1,1],  
  [1,0,1],  
  [1,1,1]  
]  
Output:   
[  
  [1,0,1],  
  [0,0,0],  
  [1,0,1]  
]

## Solutions:  
We can use two arrays of tags to record the presence or absence of zeros in each row and column. Specifically, we first traverse the array once. If an element is `0`, we set the position of the tag array corresponding to the row and column of the element to `True`. Finally, we iterate over the array again, updating the original array with the tag array.  

```python
class Solution():
    def setZeroes(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
        row, col = [False] * m, [True] * n 
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if matrix[i][j] == 0:
                    row[i] = col[j] = True          
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if row[i] or col[j]:
                    matrix[i][j] = 0
```
