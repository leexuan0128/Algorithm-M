## 0142 Linked List Cycle II
[Linked List Cycle II](https://leetcode.cn/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/)


Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to (0-indexed). It is -1 if there is no cycle. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Do not modify the linked list.


## Solutions  
Double Pointers (Fast-Slow pointer)  
Define fastï¼Œslow pointer set them equal to the position fo the head.

Slow point moves one step per movement while fast moves two steps. They are gonna meet each other in the cycle.

When the slow and fast pointer meet, set anther two pointers at the position of slow and the head. Two pointers both move one step per movement.

When they meet, the meet node is the answer.



```python
class Solution:
    def detectCycle(self, head):
        slow, fast = head, head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            if slow == fast:
                p = head
                q = slow
                while p != q:
                    p = p.next
                    q = q.next
                return p
        return None
