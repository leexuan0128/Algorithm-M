Arrays are very basic data structures in multiple programming lanuages.  

An array is a collection of the same type of data stored in contiguous memory spaces in the computer. The array can easily obtain the corresponding data by index.  

- Arrays always start at zero index.
- have contiguous addresses in memory space.

The elements of the array cannot be deleted, and it can only be covered.
